.Sh NAME
.Nm dlogd
.Nd Distributed DTrace Log Daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c Ar conffile
.Op Fl d
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon is responsible for managing distributed aspects of
.Xr dtrace 1
operation.
This primarily consists of configuring the kernel
.Xr dtrace 1
implementation to commit trace output to a
.Xr libdlog 3
log, and then performing reliable distributed spooling of trace records to a
central Kafka server.
.Xr libdlog 3
provides upper bounds on loss in the event of a node crash, as well as
reliable recovery following node or network failure.
Records can only be buffered locally on disk as long as free space remains on
the log filesystem.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c Ar conffile
Use
.Ar conffile
as the configuration file instead of the default
.Pa /etc/dlogd/dlogd.cfg
.It Fl d
Enable additional debugging output to
.Xr syslog 3
and keep
.Nm
in the foreground after start.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILE
.Nm
accepts a single configuration file that configures various operating
parameters, such as the IP address of the Kafka server to submit log
records to.
The file is processed using
.Xr libucl .
It consists of a set of global configuration settings (e.g., configuring the
client ID), and a series of topics along with per-topic settings such as
destination server.
The following global configuration variables may be set:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va cacert_file
Specify the TLS client-side certificate bundle.
Defaults to
.Pa cacert.pem .
.It Va client_file
Specify the TLS client-side certificate.
Defaults to
.Pa client.pem .
.It Va clientid
Define the Kafka client name, which will appear in Kafka server logs.
Defaults to
.Pa dlog .
.It Va log_path
Set the directory in which
.Nm
will store log files, monitoring statistics, and ofher data.
Defaults to the current working directory.
.It Va nelements
Size the producer hash table for
.Va nelements
entries.
Defaults to
.Dv 10 .
.It Va privatekey_file
Specify the TLS client-side private key file.
.It Va tls
Enable TLS support.
Defaults to
.Va false .
.It Va topics
Start the
.Va topics
block (see below).
.It Va user_password
Specify the TLS password.
Defaults to
.Va password .
.El
.Pp
The
.Va topics
section consists of a series of blocks named by their Kafka topic defining the
destination host name and port for the topic:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hostname
Sets the host name of the Kafka server to submit log records to.
.It Va port
Sets the TCP port for the Kafka server to submit log records to.
.El
.Pp
A typical configuration file might be as follows:
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent -compact
clientid = "dlogd",
log_path = "/var/db/dlogd"
topics = {
	cadets-trace {
		hostname = "192.0.2.1"
		port = 9092
	}
}

.Sh BUGS
.Xr libdlog 3
is not yet able to interface to Kafka via Zookeeper, and therefore must be
manually configured with information about the cluster leader.
.Pp
Unlike most other daemons, using the
.Fl d
flag does not enable the
.Dv LOG_PERROR
flag on
.Xr syslog 3 ,
and hence will not print log messages on the current terminal.
